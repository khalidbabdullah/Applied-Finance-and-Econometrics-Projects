# Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) — Discounted Cash Flow Valuation

This repository contains a full discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation model for Netflix, Inc., built using unlevered free cash flow to the firm (FCFF).

## Overview
The model forecasts operating performance over an explicit five-year period (2026–2030), with assumptions driven by revenue growth deceleration, operating margin expansion, capital intensity, and working capital dynamics. Cash flows are discounted using a WACC derived from CAPM-based cost of equity and observed capital structure.

Terminal value is estimated using a perpetual growth approach, and valuation outputs are presented across base, bull, and bear cases.

## Key Outputs
- Enterprise Value, Equity Value, and Implied Share Price
- FCFF build from EBIT to cash flow
- Enterprise Value bridge (PV of FCFF + PV of Terminal Value)
- Sensitivity analysis across WACC and terminal growth assumptions
- Revenue and EBIT trajectory visualization

## Key Assumptions (Base Case)
- WACC: 10.65%
- Terminal Growth Rate: 2.5%
- Effective Tax Rate: 13%
- Valuation methodology: FCFF-based DCF
